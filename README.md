## Digit Rarity 
#### V.2

Welcome to the second iteration of Digit Rarity!

If you're familiar with the first version you'll notice a different look and feel to the user interface. However, the most exciting changes are under the hood!

1. Every function was re-written and made modular resulting in less code, better organization, and easier maintenance.  
2. Version 1 was geared towards learning the basics of JavaScript, html and css, whereas Version 2 is geared towards learning React and later APIs, servers, and databases.
3. Version 1 was hosted on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and the Ethereum Network via an Ethereum Name Service (.eth) domain. Due to the static nature of IPFS, Version 2 will be hosted on a traditional DNS (.com) domain and will later involve ENS integration.

These changes will enable me to expand Digit Rarity to include new features and functionality in the near future!
