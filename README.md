## Digit Rarity 
#### V.2

Welcome to the second iteration of Digit Rarity!

If you're familiar with the first version you'll notice a different look and feel to the user interface. However, the most exciting changes are under the hood!

1. Every function was re-written and made modular resulting in a dramatic reduction in code.
2. Version 1 was a learning project geared towards learning JavaScript, html and css, whereas Version 2 is geared towards learning React.
3. Version 1 was hosted on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and the Ethereum Network. While Version 2 may initially be hosted on IPFS it will ultimately be hosted on a different CMS to allow for dynamic upgrading and database integration.

These changes will enable me to expand Digit Rarity to include new features and functionality in the near future!
