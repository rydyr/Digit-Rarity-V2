## Digit Rarity 
#### V.2

Welcome to Digit Rarity!

From license plates to domain names, number sequences have always been popular for collecting. Every culture and collecting niche may have its own standards or guidelines to what is considered desirable, but one thing remains the same: There are only so many numbers in a given range. 

In its first phase Digit Rarity seeks to be a quick and easy way to determine the relative rarity of numbers 3 - 8 digits in length by identifying type(s) and objectively calculating a score.

Understanding that in number collecting scarcity isn't a reliable metric for desirability, the second phase of Digit Rarity seeks to provide the digit collecting community the opportunity to share subjective valuations.
